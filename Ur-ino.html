        <h1>Hi, I'm Ino! ❤️</h1>
        <p>They say I'm the most loving and caring person you'll ever meet. Kind of like a teddy bear, but with better jokes. I’m the type to send good morning texts, remember your favorite coffee order, and pretend to understand all your movie references. 😆</p>
        <p>Also, I have a special talent: making people smile. I mean, you're smiling right now, aren't you? 😉</p>
